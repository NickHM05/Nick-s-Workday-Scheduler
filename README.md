# Nick's Workday Scheduler

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an interactive application of web-apis in the form of a beginner developer coding quiz that the user can save their initials and score.

This project was built to study some of the puzzeling questions that young developers can face and how to answer them in the form of a game.

I learned how to implement a timer and a high score webpage for the user to have when playing the game which is something ive never known how to do before.Using a list of lists to create the questions for the user to use was very useful.
